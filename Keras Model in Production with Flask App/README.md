# How to Deploy a Keras Model to Production


## Overview
 
We're going to build a model that recognizes handwritten digit images (MNIST).  Developed using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and the super simple [Keras](http://keras.io/) Library. Wrapped into a Webapp using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) Micro Framework.

## Usage

Once dependencies are installed, just run this to see it in your browser. 
```set FLASK_APP=app.py```
```python -m flask run```

That's it! It's serving a saved Keras model to you via Flask. 

## Future

You can now use any of the model and deploy your model for the production.
