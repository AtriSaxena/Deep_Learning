    "- Step 1 - Train our model with Keras run \"MNIST Keras Model creater.ipynb\"\n",
    "- Step 2 - Save our model & json \n",
    "- Step 3 - Write our Flask backend to serve our saved model (then look at dep classes (load.py, index.js, index.html)\n",
    "- Step 4 - Deploy our code to Google Cloud\n",

    "- We use Keras with a Tensorflow backend to train a small 8 layer Convolutional Network to recognize handwritten character digits\n",
    "- We use Flask as our backend for serving these pretrained models. You can check Flask documentation here https:flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart \n",

    "- Keras.js https://github.com/transcranial/keras-js Run Keras models in the browser (python backend, JS front-end) with GPU support. \n",
    "- WebDNN https://github.com/mil-tokyo/webdnn (but converting the model to its required format requires OS X (Specifically the xcode dependency 'metal' for running GPU operations). Not everyone uses OS X! Although Francois Chollet is a fan and its also faster than this. But this has more examples.\n",
